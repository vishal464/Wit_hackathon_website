##Whats the problem?
  In India, the quantity of “e-waste” or electronic waste has now become a major problem. Disposal of e-waste is an emerging global environmental and public health issue, as this waste has become the most rapidly growing segment of the formal municipal waste stream in the world.(1) E-waste or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) are loosely discarded, surplus, obsolete, broken, electrical or electronic devices.(2) In India most of the waste electronic items are stored at households as people do not know how to discard them. This ever-increasing waste is very complex in nature and is also a rich source of metals such as gold, silver, and copper, which can be recovered and brought back into the production cycle.
 #How can the technology help?
  The technology can help by making it easier for users to dispose the e-waste materials through proper channels.This not only eases waste management process but also helps in generating employment for a lot of people.
 #The idea
  Our idea is to launch an eCommerce platform where the people can register and give away their e-waste / unused or damaged electronic materials in exchange of money and/(or) credit points.These credit points can be redeemed in the partnered websites for their services.Further we sell recylced products directly from companies on the website. This is to encourage circular economy in the community.
